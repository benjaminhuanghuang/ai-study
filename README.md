# Machine Learning Study Project
Al is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.

Machine learning is all about programming the un-programmable. ML gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programming.
- Unsupervised learning (data is labeled). e.g. Prediction
- Supervised learning (data is not labeled). e.g. Clustering
- Reinforcement learning
- Deep learning: using Artificial Neural Networks
    - Generative: generate new data
    - Discriminative: classify or predict
