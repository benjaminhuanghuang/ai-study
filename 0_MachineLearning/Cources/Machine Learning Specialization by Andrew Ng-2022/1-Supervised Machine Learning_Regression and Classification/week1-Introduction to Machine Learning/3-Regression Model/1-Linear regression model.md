# Linear regression model
Regression model predicts a number.
Linear regression fits a straight line to your data.

x = "input" variable = feature

y = "output" variable = target variable

m = number of training examples


feature -> Model -> prediction/estimated target



## Cost function
Tell us how well the model is doing so that we can try to get it to do better
The goal of linear regression is to find the parameters w or w and b that results in the smallest possible value for the cost function J.
