Machine learning 
"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
Arthur Samuel (1959)

## Supervised Learning
Learn from data labeled with "right answer"

## Supervised Learning 1: Regression
Predict x y mapping

Predict a number, infinitely many possible outputs

# Supervised Learning 2: Classification

Predicting categories, small number of possible outputs


## Unsupervised Learning
Find some structure/pattern in unlabeled data

### Unsupervised Learning 1: Clustering
Grouping similar data together

clustering news, DNA micro-array, grouping customer


### Unsupervised Learning 2: 
Anomaly Detection: Find unusual data points
Dimensionality Reduction: Data compression using fewer numbers, visualization
