Machine learning is programming by optimization. We need math to understand that optimization.

## linear algebra
to understand the objects being optimized, data, models, parameters are 

for solving equations with vectors and matrices instead of just number

## calculus
to understand how we optimize, with tiny changes

Methods for studying rates of change and areas

## probability and statistics

 to understand what we want to optimize, reduce surprise/uncertainty
