## Constant rule
Derivative of a Constant = 0
```
    differentiating(c) = 0
``` 
Intuition: A constant has no variation so its slope is nothing


## Power Rule
```
    differentiating(x^n) = n * x^(n-1)
```
## Constant product Rule
```
    differentiating(c * y) = c * differentiating(y)
```


## Sum rule 
```
    differentiating(y + w) = differentiating(y) + differentiating(y)
```

## Product rule
```
    differentiating(y * w) = y * differentiating(w) + w * differentiating(y)
```
Useful:
• During calculations involving several rules
• Whenever product is incalculable pre-diff.


## Quotient rule
```
    differentiating(y / z) = [z * differentiating(y) - y * differentiating(w)] / w^2
``` 


## Chain rule
```
    differentiating(y(w(x))) = differentiating(y) * differentiating(w)
```
