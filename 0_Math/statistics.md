Measures of central tendency:

- The mean: A simple average based on adding together all of the values in the sample set and then dividing the total by the number of samples.
- The median: The value in the middle of the range of all of the sample values.
- The mode: The most commonly occurring value in the sample set.
  
Typical statistics that measure variability in the data include:

- Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum. There's no built-in function for this, but it's easy to calculate using the min and max functions.

- Variance: The average of the squared difference from the mean. You can use the built-in var function to find this.

- Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance. You can use the built-in std function to find this.

The higher the standard deviation, the more variance there is when comparing values in the distribution to the distribution mean; in other words, the data is more spread out.
