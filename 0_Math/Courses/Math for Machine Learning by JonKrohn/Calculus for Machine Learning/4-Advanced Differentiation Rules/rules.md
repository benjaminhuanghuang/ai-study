## Product rule
```
    differentiating(y * w) = y * differentiating(w) + w * differentiating(y)
```
Useful:
• During calculations involving several rules
• Whenever product is incalculable pre-diff.


## Quotient rule
```
    differentiating(y / z) = [z * differentiating(y) - y * differentiating(w)] / w^2
``` 


## Chain rule
```
    differentiating(y(w(x))) = differentiating(y) * differentiating(w)
```
