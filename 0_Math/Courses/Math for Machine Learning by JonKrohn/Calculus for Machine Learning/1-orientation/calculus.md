## What is Calculus
Mathematical study of continuous change

## Differential calculus: study of rates of change, how phenomenon changes over time.

derivative is the slope of the the tangent line at a point, 
slop = change in y / change in x
acceleration = speed / time
speed = distance / time

Use differential calculus to calculate the derivative of a function.


## Integral calculus: study of area under a curve
distance = area under the curve of speed.

calculate the infinitesimals

As integral accuracy improves as we approach an `infinite-sided Polygon`, 
differential accuracy improve as we approach a `curve infinitely closely`.


## Modern calculus applications
Differentials: optimized by finding minima and maximums of curves. Gradient descent to minimize loss function. Gradient ascent to maximize reward.


Integrals: calculate area under a curve.
