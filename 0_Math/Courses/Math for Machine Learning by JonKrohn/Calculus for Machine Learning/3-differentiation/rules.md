## Constant rule
Derivative of a Constant = 0
```
    differentiating(c) = 0
``` 
Intuition: A constant has no variation so its slope is nothing


## Power Rule
```
    differentiating(x^n) = n * x^(n-1)
```
## Constant product Rule
```
    differentiating(c * y) = c * differentiating(y)
```


## Sum rule 
```
    differentiating(y + w) = differentiating(y) + differentiating(y)
```
