## DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
• The derivative equation is used to describe the rate of change of a function
• Finding the minimum or maximum value of a given function
• Uses a process called differentiation
• Derivatives are used to determine the `instantaneous` rate of change of a function
• Differentiation is the process of dividing something into smaller parts to track changes
• Used to determine if a function is increasing or decreasing

## INTEGRAL CALCULUS
• Concerned with finding the area under the curve
• Uses a process called integration
• Integration is the reverse process of differentiation
• Uses integrals to determine the area under the curve
• Integration sums up `infinitesimal` pieces to get the total area under the curve
• Used to find areas, volumes, and central points


## Applications of Calculus in ML
• Optimization problem: to train models, we use derivatives
• Optimization algorithm called gradient descent uses derivatives to decide whether to increase or decrease weights in order to
maximize or minimize some objective
• Increasing or decreasing the weights, we can maximize or minimize the model's accuracy or error function
• Integrals are used in Bayesian methods using probability density functions to perform the desired Bayesian computations
• Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues
• Backpropagation in neural networks
