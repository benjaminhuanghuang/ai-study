## Derivative
To approximate the amount of change at any point on the nonlinear function curve, we can draw a tangent line

I A tangent line is a line that locally touches a curve at one and only one point

The derivative is the measurement of the `slope` of the line tangent to f(x) at every point



## Differentiable
if the limit exists, the function is differentiable at that point


## Derivative used in ML
GRADIENT DESCENT: The optimization technique based on derivatives and iteration that is used to minimize or maximize
a set of parameters against an objective

## Derivative rules
- The constant rule:
Let c be a constant. If f(x) = c, then f'(x) = 0

- The power rule:
Let n be a positive integer. If f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n*x^(n-1)

- Product rule:
The derivative of the product = derivative of the first function * the second function + the derivative of the second function * the first function.

- Quotient rule:
  
- Chain rule:
