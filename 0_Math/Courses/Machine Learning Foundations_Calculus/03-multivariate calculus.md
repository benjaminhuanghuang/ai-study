## Multivariable functions
Function has tow or more variables

To calculate the derivative of a multivariable function, we have to find the derivative of each variable separately

`Partial derivatives` are derivatives of functions that have multiple input variables

When calculating the partial derivative with respect to a particular variable, you have to treat all the other variables as constants.


## Higher order derivatives

High-order derivatives refer to derivatives of a function taken with respect to a variable multiple times. In other words, if you take the derivative of a function repeatedly, you are calculating high-order derivatives. The order of a derivative indicates how many times the differentiation operation has been applied.
