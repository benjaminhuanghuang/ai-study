## What is statistics?
Descriptive statistics vs inferential statistics
- Descriptive statistics usually include things like `where the middle of the data is` - what statisticians call measures of central tendency - and measures of `how spread out the data are`. 

- Inferential statistics are used to `make inferences` about a larger population of data based on a smaller sample of data.
