## RNN Features
- The same neural network is used at each time step
    Layers, nodes, weights, biases, and activations
    As simple or as deep as it can be
- Two inputs: current input and previous hidden state
- Two outputs: current output and next hidden state

## Types of RNNs
Many-to-many RNNs
- Each time step has an input and an output
- E.g., speech recognition, machine translation


Many-to-One RNNs
- Each time step has an input and the output produced at the last time step
- E.g., Stock price prediction, sentiment analysis

One-to-Many RNNs
- A single input produces multiple outputs
- E.g., music synthesis


Encoder-Decoder RNNs
- Multiple inputs go into encoder, Multiple outputs come out of decoder
- E.g., machine translation, text summarization


One-to-One RNNs
- This is the classic neural network
- E.g., predict customer propensity
