# Linear Regression
Regression is where models predict a number.

Regression works by establishing a relationship between variables in the data that represent characteristics—known as the `features`—of the thing being observed, and the variable we're trying to predict—known as the `label`. 

When we're talking about ‘training a model’, what we mean is finding a function that can use x to calculate the y. 

Fit a line to a data set of observations.
Use the line to predict a unobserved value of y for a given value of x


Mean Squared Error (MSE)


Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).


## Usage
