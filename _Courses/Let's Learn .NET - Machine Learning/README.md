- Artificial Intelligence
The ability of a computer to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings (reason, discover
meaning. generalize, learn from past experience)

Given rules + data, get answers

- Machine Learning
Getting computers to make predictions `without being explicitly programmed`

Given answer + data, get rules

problem to solve:
Categorize items: data classification, Image classification, Object detection
Predict a value / number: Regression, Forecasting
Make suggestions: Recommendation, Ranking
Find outliers: anomaly detection
Find relationships: Clustering


- Deep Learning
Subset of ML based on `artificial neural networks` which imitate the way the human brain learns, thinks, and
processes data.


- ML workflow:
Model Training (Get the data > Prepare the data > Train > Evaluate) > Model Consumption (Deploy > Inference)
