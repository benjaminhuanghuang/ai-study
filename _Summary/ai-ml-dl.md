## Artificial Intelligence
The ability of a computer to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings (reason, discover
meaning. generalize, learn from past experience)

Given rules + data, get answers

## Machine Learning
Getting computers to make predictions `without being explicitly programmed`

Given answer + data, get rules

Machine learning is a technique that uses mathematics and statistics to identify patterns in data without being explicitly programmed

### problem to solve:
- Categorize items: data classification, Image classification, Object detection
- Predict a value / number: Regression, Forecasting
- Make suggestions: Recommendation, Ranking
- Find outliers: anomaly detection
- Find relationships: Clustering


## Deep Learning
Subset of ML based on `artificial neural networks` which imitate the way the human brain learns, thinks, and
processes data.
