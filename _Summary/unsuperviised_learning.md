## Unsupervised learning

In unsupervised learning, we train a model to solve a problem without us knowing the correct answer. In fact, unsupervised learning is typically used for problems where `there isn't one correct answer`, but instead, better and worse solutions.


only difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is `how the objective function works`.
