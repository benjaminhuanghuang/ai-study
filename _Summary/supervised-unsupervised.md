Machine learning tasks tend to fall into two categories:

Supervised Learning: 
- Have labeled data (already tagged with right answer)
- Try to find label of new data

Unsupervised Learning
- Do not have labeled data
- Finds unknown patterns in data

Features are the inputs that determine the value you're trying to predict.

The value that you're trying to predict is often called a label.

## Tasks
- Supervised (label is known)
  - Classification
    - Binary (two categories)
    - Multiclass (two or more categories)
    - Image
  - Regression(Value prediction)
- Unsupervised (label is unknown)
  - Clustering
  - Anomaly detection
