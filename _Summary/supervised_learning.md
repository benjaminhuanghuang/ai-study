# Supervised learning

Supervised learning is a form of machine learning where an algorithm learns from examples of data.

Supervised learning automatically generates a model that can make predictions about the real world.

only difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is `how the objective function works`.

we need both:
- Features that are provided as inputs to the model
- Labels, which are the correct answers that we want the model to be able to produce
