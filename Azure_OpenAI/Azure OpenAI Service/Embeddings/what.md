An embedding is a special format of `data representation` that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms.

The embedding is an `information dense representation` of the `semantic meaning` of a piece of text.

Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, `if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar`.

LLMs automatically learn how to embed words and concepts.

Most modern language models work on embeddings. 

An embedding is a continuous vector.
