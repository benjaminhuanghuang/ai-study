Data exploration and analysis is typically an `iterative process`, in which the data scientist takes a sample of data and performs the following kinds of task to analyze it and test hypotheses:

- Clean data to handle errors, missing values, and other issues.

- Apply statistical techniques to better understand the data, and how the sample might be expected to represent the real-world population of data, allowing for random variation.

- Visualize data to determine relationships between variables, and in the case of a machine learning project, identify features that are potentially predictive of the label.

- Revise the hypothesis and repeat the process.

## Examine the real world data
Remember, real-world data will always have issues, but this is often a surmountable problem. Remember to:
- Check for missing values and badly recorded data
- Consider removal of obvious outliers
- Consider what real-world factors might affect your analysis and consider if your dataset size is large enough to handle this
- Check for biased raw data and consider your options to fix this, if found
