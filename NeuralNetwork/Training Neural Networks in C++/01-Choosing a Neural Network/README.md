## What a Neural Network Is
- A piece of software.
- A model of the brain
- Capable of reproducing some behaviors of the brain
- Capable of learning and classifying


## Supervised Learning
- Regression
  - Linear, logistic, exponential
- Classification
    - Support vector machines
    - Neural networks
    - Decision trees

## Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Neural networks

## Reinforcement Learning
- Video game playing AI

## Types of Classifiers
- Logistic Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Feedforward Neural Networks : most basic type of neural network which consists of several layers of neurons propagating data from input to output.
